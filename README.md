### Most basic hot key terminal wrapper for macos with hammerspoon

Over the last 10 years I have developed a deep, deep dependence on hot-key terminals. (TDrop on linux is amazing BTW). I know iTerm has one built in. I hate iTerm. I just want a f'n terminal not a spaceship. So... this is the most basic functionality so that I don't smash my work macbook to pieces, i.e. This is missing loads of functionality! Please add more, improve. When i've got a second there's plenty more I want to add.

If you know any other hotkey wrappers for terminals on macos, please let me know!

To use:
1. Set whatever terminal identifier in the init
2. Set hotkey
3. Load in your hammerspoon init.lua

```shell
hs.loadSpoon("HotTerm")
```
